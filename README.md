This is a simple function for the game Fizzbuzz i created using JavaScript,
i also edited the JavaScript so the result would print on HTML instead of console.

rules of the game are simple.
Any number divisible by 3 is replaced with the word "Fizz",
Any number divisible by 5 is replaced with the word "Buzz",
Numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced with the word "Fizzbuzz".
